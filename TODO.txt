Use the current system for now as supposedly all plugins work with leaflet >= v1.0.0
in a next release, upgrade to use npm and webpack.  (not random files and grunt/browserify)
  npm can manage the files and versions while not keeping the raw distributions and never ending 'ignores' in the code base
  webpack can bundle each js and css distribution for each module to be sourced by htmlwidgets

use the bower setup to load the npm packages and save to dev







upgrade awesome markers to 2.0.3
add bootstrap with awesome marker
add font.awesome with awesome marker
add ionicons.min.css with awesome marker


finish changing all of the system files to not use /lib and /plugin, but /bower /bindings
